These are a few cogs I made for myself that may be useful to others. Mostly utility-based.
These are for [Red V3](https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot/), an open source self-hosted Discord bot. If this is your first time with Red,
take a look at the [docs](https://docs.discord.red).


## Getting my cogs

`[p]` is your prefix.

Add the repo: `[p]repo add rusty-cogs https://github.com/inpprenable/rusty-cogs`

Then you can install cogs: `[p]cog install rusty-cogs cogname`

There's a list of cogs below, or you can use `[p]cog list rusty-cogs` if you've added the repo.

| Cog name            | Description |
|---------------------| --- |
| [chacall](chacall/) | Get all the information you could ever need about a command's aliases. |

[//]: # (All these cogs have docs! My docs [are here]&#40;https://cogdocs.vexcodes.com/en/latest&#41; or click on the cog name to go directly to that cog's docs page.)

The [Vex-Cogs](https://github.com/Vexed01/Vex-Cogs) repo because I shamefully stole the MD file from there.

And finally, most importantly, the Cog Creators who made the wonderful Red framework.
